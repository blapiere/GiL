# GiL

GiL (Gecode interface Lisp) is a wrapper that allows to use Gecode in Lisp program.

## How to use
Install Gecode, a Common Lisp implementation and CFFI. You are ready to load the library and use it!

## How to improve GiL
GiL does not provide full wrapping of Gecode. The **Gil introduction** pdf from my master's thesis explains what is missing and suggests ways to improve it.
